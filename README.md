# Alexa Rant
Alexa fetches a random rant from <https://devrant.com/feed> at your request. This was a simple project to play around with Alexa Skills Kit.

## Available commands
After opening `rant` application on Alexa you can say the following commands:
* `rant`
* `give me a rant`
* `tell me a rant`
* `are there any rants`
* `what does the dev say`

There's a very useful talk given by Andrea Muttoni going through the process of setting up your Alexa Skill if you are thinking of making your own: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB3wwxgqPOU&t=919s
